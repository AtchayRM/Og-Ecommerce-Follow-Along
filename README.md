Ecommerce-Follow-Along

# Milestone 1 - Project Overview

The Ecommerce-Follow-Along project aims to build a fully functional e-commerce application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js).

The project includes user authentication, which ensures secure login and registration functionality. It also allows for product management by enabling users to add, update, and retrieve product data. The system handles customer orders by integrating backend processes and builds a REST API for communication between the client and server. MongoDB schema design is implemented to create structured data models for managing users, products, and orders.

The tech stack used includes React.js for the frontend, Node.js and Express.js for the backend, MongoDB for the database, and JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.

# Milestone 2: Project Setup and Login Page

This milestone focuses on setting up the project structure and implementing a basic login page.

The project is initialized with the required dependencies and folder structure. A simple login page is created with fields for the username and password. The frontend is developed using React and styled with Tailwind CSS.

# Milestone 3: Server Setup and Error Handling

In this milestone, the backend code is organized with a clear folder structure. A Node.js server is configured using Express to handle APIs. MongoDB is integrated for data storage and management, and basic error handling is implemented to ensure smooth server operations. The backend relies on Node.js, Express, and MongoDB with Mongoose.

# Milestone 4: User Management System with File Upload

This milestone involves creating a simple user management system that allows the creation, retrieval, and management of user data. It supports file uploads, such as profile pictures, using Multer. A user model is created as a blueprint for storing user data in the database. The user controller handles operations like adding, retrieving, and updating user information. The system also accepts and stores user-uploaded files, including profile images. The code is well-documented for ease of use.

# Milestone 5: Project Signup Setup

The project structure is set up, and a basic signup page is created with fields for the user's name, email, password, and profile picture. The frontend is developed using React.

# Milestone 6: Password Encryption and User Data Storage

Passwords are encrypted using bcrypt before storing them in the database. User data is securely saved in the database. The backend is handled using Node.js.

# Milestone 7: User Login and Validation

During login, the system validates user credentials by comparing the encrypted password with the user’s input. If the user is not found or the password is incorrect, an error message is returned. The backend relies on bcryptjs for password handling.

# Milestone 8: Product Card Component and Homepage

A reusable product card component is created to showcase product details. Products are dynamically displayed on the homepage using props and mapping. The frontend is developed using React.

# Milestone 9: Create Product Page

A create product page is developed where users can add and remove images. It allows for previewing images and adding details such as the product name, description, category, tags, price, and stock information. The frontend is built using React.

# Milestone 10: Product Schema and API Endpoint

A Mongoose schema for products is created to define the structure of product data. An API endpoint is written to store product details in the MongoDB database. The backend relies on Node.js and Mongoose.

# Milestone 11: Dynamic Homepage

An API endpoint is written to send all product data to the frontend. Products are dynamically displayed using the product card component. The frontend is built using React, and the backend is handled with Node.js.

# Milestone 12: My Products Page

An endpoint is created to filter and display user-specific products. The filtered data is displayed using the product card component. The frontend is developed using React, and the backend is managed with Node.js.

# Milestone 13: Edit Products

An edit button is added to update product details. The form is pre-filled with existing data, and the updated details are saved to the MongoDB database. The frontend is built using React, and the backend relies on Node.js.

# Milestone 14: Delete Products

An API endpoint is written to delete a product by its ID. A delete button is added to the product card to allow users to remove products. The frontend is created using React, and the backend is managed with Node.js.

# Milestone 15: Navbar Component

A Navbar component is created with links to all pages, ensuring smooth navigation between pages. The Navbar is designed to be responsive. The frontend is built using React.

# Milestone 16: Product Info Page

A product details page is created to display detailed product information. A quantity selector and an add-to-cart button are added to the page. The frontend is developed using React.

# Milestone 17: Add to Cart

An API endpoint is written to add products to the cart. The cart data is stored in the database. The frontend is built using React, and the backend is managed with Node.js.

# Milestone 18: Fetch Cart Data

An API endpoint is created to fetch products in the cart. The cart items are dynamically displayed on the frontend. The frontend is developed using React, and the backend is handled with Node.js.

# Milestone 19: Cart Quantity Adjustment

Buttons are added to increase and decrease product quantity in the cart. An API endpoint is written to update product quantity in the database. The frontend is built using React, and the backend is managed with Node.js.

# Milestone 20: Profile Page

A profile page is created to display user data, including the user’s name, email, and profile picture. An "Add Address" button is added to allow users to input their address. The frontend is developed using React, and the backend is handled with Node.js.

# Milestone 21: Address Form

An address form is created to collect user address details. The user input is stored in state using React.

# Milestone 22: Save Address to Database

An API endpoint is created to save user address data to the MongoDB database. The backend is managed with Node.js.

# Milestone 23: Select Address Page

A "Place Order" button is added to the cart page, which redirects users to a select address page. A schema is written to store order details in the database. The frontend is developed using React, and the backend is handled with Node.js.

# Milestone 24: Order Confirmation Page

An order confirmation page is created to display the order summary and delivery address. The total price and order details are shown on the page. The frontend is developed using React, and the backend is managed with Node.js.
